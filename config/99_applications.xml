<!-- this is an example with comments through out. use these to make your own
     rules, but without the comments of course.

the name or the class can be set, or both. this is used to match windows when
they appear. role can optionally be set as well, to further restrict your
matches. the name, class, and role use simple wildcard matching such as those
used by a shell. you can use * to match any characters and ? to match any single
character. when multiple rules match a window, they will all be applied, in the
order that they appear in this list each element can be left out or set to
'default' to specify to not change that attribute of the window.

<application name="first element of window's WM_CLASS property (see xprop)"
             class="second element of window's WM_CLASS property (see xprop)"
             role="the window's WM_WINDOW_ROLE property (see xprop)">

enable or disable window decorations
<decor>yes</decor>

make the window shaded when it appears, or not
<shade>no</shade>

the position is only used if both an x and y coordinate are provided (and not
set to 'default').
<position>
    a number like 50, or 'center' to center on screen. use a negative number to
    start from the right (or bottom for <y>), ie -50 is 50 pixels from the right
    edge (or bottom).
    <x>center</x>
    <y>200</y>
    specifies the monitor in a xinerama setup.
    1 is the first head, or 'mouse' for wherever the mouse is
    <monitor>1</monitor>
</position>

if the window should try be given focus when it appears. if this is set to yes
it doesn't guarantee the window will be given focus. some restrictions may
apply, but Openbox will try to.
<focus>yes</focus>

    1 is the first desktop, 'all' for all desktops.
    <desktop>1</desktop>

    'above', 'normal', or 'below'.
    <layer>normal</layer>

    make the window iconified when it appears, or not.
    <iconic>no</iconic>

    asks to not be shown in pagers.
    <skip_pager>no</skip_pager>

    asks to not be shown in taskbars. window cycling actions will also skip
    past such windows.
    <skip_taskbar>no</skip_taskbar>

    make the window in fullscreen mode when it appears.
    <fullscreen>yes</fullscreen>

    'Horizontal', 'Vertical' or boolean (yes/no).
    <maximized>true</maximized>
</application>

     end of the example.
